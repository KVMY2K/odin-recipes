    <h2>Stew for the cold season!</h2>
    <p>The best way to prepare beef meat is to make a nice stew
        out of it. And it's totally customizable too!
        You may add any vegetables of your liking, or substitute
        any ingredient with something else. Need a vegan option?
        Swap the meat for tofu. Don't like carrots? Add sweet potatoes instead.
        This is how I make it, but you are free to customize it however you see fit.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg beef shank</li>
        <li>400g tomatoes</li>
        <li>0.5kg potatoes</li>
        <li>3 large carrots</li>
        <li>1 small celery</li>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>1/2 head garlic</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper of each color</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>1l beef stock</li>
        <li>1 bottle of red wine</li>
        <li>100 ml cream</li>
        <li>sour cream</li>
        <li>bayleafs</li>
        <li>pepper and paprika</li>
        <li>sourdough bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut in the meat slightly on the sides to avoid it curling up</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes to roughly equal sized, large cubes, and soak them</li>
        <li>Cut one carrot, the celery, onions, and garlic to as small cubes as you can</li>
        <li>Cut the remaining carrots to larger cubes, akin to the potatoes</li>
        <li>Cut up the bell peppers roughly, around the same size as the carrots</li>
        <li>Have a glass of wine</li>
        <li>Sear the meat on both sizes over olive oil in a large enough pot for your stew</li>
        <li>Remove the seared meat and add a glass of wine to make a demiglaze</li>
        <li>Stir it until the bottom is smooth, and remove the demiglaze</li>
        <li>Cook the fine veggies in olive oil</li>
        <li>Add in the tomatoes when the veggies are ready</li>
        <li>When it's reducing, add in your spices and put back the meat and the demiglaze</li>
        <li>Add in half the stock, turn the heat down to low, put on a lid</li>
        <li>Simmer for 2-3 hours, gradually replacing the reducing stock</li>
        <li>Before the last stock exchange (haha!), add in the roughly chopped veggies and cream</li>
        <li>Cook until veggies are done</li>
        <li>Plate it, top it with olive oil, sour cream, and serve it with sourdough</li>
        <li>Don't forget the wine!</li>
    </ol>
