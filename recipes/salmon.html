    <h2>Fish and butter = Heavenly dishes</h2>
    <p>Fish is superior to meat in almost all cases, I will die on this hill.
        The reason I say almost, is because I adore stews like
         <a href="../recipes/beefstew.html">this</a>. But this recipe is about fish,
         and in particular one of the most popular of them all, salmon.
         I will show you my recipe, and my favorite side pairs for this fantastic fish steak.</p>
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 piece of salmon fillet</li>
        <li>400g potatoes</li>
        <li>200g asparagus</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>LOT of butter</li>
        <li>50 ml milk</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>thyme</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and cut up the potatoes, soak them, and put them in boiling water</li>
        <li>Have a glass of wine</li>
        <li>Cook the salmon over oil on all sides until brown, especially the skin</li>
        <li>When brown, turn down the heat slightly, add butter, thyme, and unpeeled garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Make sure the butter is plenty enough so you can baste the salmon in it</li>
        <li>Let it rest, then put the asparagus in the same pan and fry it with some extra butter</li>
        <li>When finished, let it rest, and smash the potatoes when ready</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper (roughly grated is the best), the milk, and butter to your liking</li>
        <li>Plate it up, and add lemon juice to taste (I like to add it on my puree too)</li>
    </ol>
